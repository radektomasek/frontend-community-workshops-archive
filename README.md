# Frontend Community Workshops Archive

Welcome to the **Frontend Community Workshops Archive**! This repository serves as a collection of learning materials I developed to promote knowledge sharing and collaboration on modern frontend principles during my time at [OVO Energy](https://www.ovoenergy.com)/[Kaluza](https://www.kaluza.com/).

This is a curated selection of my favorite topics that were covered in our Frontend Community of Practice. These materials were created primarily during the pandemic (2020/2021), a time when staying updated with modern frontend technologies was both a necessity and a passion project for me.

While some content may be slightly dated due to older library versions, I‚Äôm actively working to bring everything up to speed. Migrating my personal notes into a public repository was a big first step, and I‚Äôm excited to share these resources with a broader audience.
